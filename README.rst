Lutris
------

Lutris is a gaming platform for GNU/Linux. Its goal is to make gaming on Linux
as easy as possible by taking care of installing and setting up the game for
the user. The only thing you have to do is play the game. It aims to support
every game that is playable on Linux.


Configuration files
-------------------

All the configuration files are in YAML format. YAML is very easy to understand
and to use in Python. For more information visit http://yaml.org

By default, configuration files will be stored in ~/.config/lutris

Lutris' configuration system is a hierarchy, the deeper you go in the hierarchy
the higher priority they have.
There are three levels :
 - User configuration
 - Runner configuration
 - Game

System configuration is able to change system settings such as the
screen resolution or the audio library you use.

Runner configuration is more specific, you can change option specific to the
runner like setting a registry key in Wine. 

Game configuration is specific to a single game. If the game uses
configuration files this is the place to change them, like for example
displaying the FPS count in Quake 3.
