Creating a runner module:


    def __init__(self,settings=None):
        self.executable = "name of the executable"
        self.package = "Debian package"
        self.description = "Short description of the capabilities of the runner"
        self.machine = "Which machine does this runner runs ?" 
        
    def play(self)
        return [self.executable,"command","line","with","arguments"]
