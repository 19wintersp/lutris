Manual test suite
-----------------

These steps must be followed and succeed for each new release of Lutris.
It is advised to run these tests on a clean system (a 2nd computer or a dual
boot should be helpful here).

Supported systems:
The tests should be run on any of these systems (32 or 64bit):
    - Ubuntu LTS and current
    - OpenSUSE current
    - Fedora current
    - Debian testing or sid (stable isn't supported officially)
    - Archlinux
Any other distrution is good but is not a requirement.

1. Wipe/backup any trace of Lutris and runners.

* Move lutris settings.

mv ~/.config/lutris ~/.config/lutris.bak
mv ~/.cache/lutris ~/.cache/lutris.bak
mv ~/.local/share/lutris ~/.local/share/lutris.bak

* Remove any runner globally installed.

sudo apt-get remove wine
sudo apt-get remove steam

* Create an empty folder to put your games in.

mkdir ~/games-testing

2. Get and install lutris

* Fetch the code

git clone https://github.com/lutris/lutris
cd lutris

option 1: install with python

sudo python setup.py install

option 2: package and install the .deb/.rpm (better)

# This step will require you to have the required packaging tools
make build-all

Scenario 1: Launching Lutris
- You can find a lutris icon in your menu/launcher (Unity dash, GS launcher,
  XFCE main menu, ...) in the games category
- When clicking the interface loads with no complains
- After the UI has been opened, there should be ~/.config/lutris,
  ~/.cache/lutris and ~/.local/share/lutris directories
