Installing Lutris
=================

Requirements
------------

These are the requirements I was able to find on the development machine.
Lutris should work on any Gnome system but the runner installation is currently
tied to Software Center so it works only on Ubuntu and Debian.  In the future,
the installation process will use a distro independent mechanism.
In order to run Lutris, install the following packages.

    * python == 2.7
    * python-xdg
    * python-yaml
    * PyGobject

If you want to manually install runners you can choose from the list below
and install the ones you wish to use.

    * wine
    * scummvm
    * uae
    * mednafen
    * sdlmame
    * snes9x-gtk
    * gens-gs
    * steam (using wine)
    * atari800
    * dolphin-emu
    * frotz
    * dosbox
    * hatari
    * jzintv
    * mednafen
    * mupen64plus
    * nulldc (1.0.3 only, using wine)
    * o2em
    * openmsx
    * osmose
    * pcsxr
    * scummvm

Installation
------------

Lutris uses Python's distutils framework for installation. In order to
install Lutris, you will need root access. To install Lutris, perform
the following command as root:

      $ python setup.py install

Run Lutris
-----------

If you installed Lutris using the setup.py script, you can launch the
program by typing "lutris" at the command line. If you want to run
Lutris without installing it, start "bin/lutris" from within the
Lutris directory.
