Lutris
------

Lutris is a gaming platform for GNU/Linux. It's goal is to make 
gaming on Linux as easy as possible by taking care of installing
and setting up the game for the user. The only thing you have to 
do is play the game. It aims to support every game that is playable
on Linux. 


Configuration files
-------------------

All the configuration files are in YAML format. YAML is very easy to understand
and to use in Python. For more information visit http://yaml.org

By default, configuration files will be stored in ~/.config/lutris

Lutris' configuration system is a hierarchy, the deeper you go in the hierarchy
the higher priority they have. 
There are three levels :
 - User configuration
 - Runner configuration
 - Game 

User configuration is able to change system settings such as the 
screen resolution or the audio library you use. 

Runner configuration is more specific, you can change option specific to the
runner like setting a registry key in Wine. You can also override default and 
user configuration in here. 

Game configuration is specific to a very specific game. If the game uses 
configuration files this is the place to change them, like for example 
displaying the FPS count in Quake 3. You can also override runner, user and 
default configuration here. 

***************************
* Main configuration file *
***************************

This file set the program's configuration (in the root "config" section) and
The possible keys for the "config" section are:

 - hide_panels : hide Gnome's panels while playing (boolean)
 - screensaver : inhibit the screesaver while playin (boolean)
 - oss_wrapper : the program used to activate oss sound, can be aoss for alsa
, padsp for pulseaudio or none
 - reset_pulse : kill pulseaudio and restart it, some games need this. 
Activating this setting can mess with your applications that use pulseaudio so
it's better to quit any application that uses pulseaudio before launching a game
with this option
 - user_wm : the user's window manager such as metacity, kwin, openbox or compiz 
 - game_wm : the window manager you wish to use when playing a game
 
the runners configuration (in "runner" sections where runner is the name of the 
runner's class)

****************************
* Games configuration file *
****************************

A game configuration file must have a "main" section, this sections has 
mandatory keys which are :
 - system : the runner used for the game
 - realname : the name that will be displayed in the game list
 
Some keys are dependent of the runner and are usually related to the game
location and data needed to run the game:

For most runners "path" will be used as the location for the game
Runners that use floppy disk image or isos use the key "disk"
Emulators will usually have a "rom" key

The game config file can have a "runner" section where runner is the value given
by the "main/system" key and not actually "runner"
The options given in this section will override the runner's default
configuration.
The game config file can also have a "config" section which will override Lutris
default options.
